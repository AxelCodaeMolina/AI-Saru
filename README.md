# AI-Saru

A repository for the AI Saru project. You will find Python scripts for detection and identification of macaques via Deep Learning and social networks analysis. By Axel Molina, with the help of Julien Paulet, Benjamin Beltzung and CÃ©dric Sueur.

Molina_Paulet_AISaru.ipynb :
This is the code used in the 10/10/2023 version of the preprint Deep Learning for Automatic Detection and Facial Recognition in Japanese Macaques: Illuminating Social Networks by Paulet et al., 2023.
We suggest reading the methods provided in the article if anything is unclear in this notebook.
You can find the preprint here: https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2310.06489

AISaruTool.ipynb :
This is the tool developed in the 2024 paper. This version uses more recent models and data.

Both .ipynb have instructions on how to run the code in them. You can simply open them in Google Colab and use them !

.pt files :
Those are the weights of the models we trained, you can use them to detect and identify macaques !

Please note that this is still a work in project, we will do our best to provide a simple beginner friendly code so that anyone can use it and expend on it. If you need any help running the code or if you have any question feel free to contact Axel Molina by email using either molina.axel@ens.psl.eu or molina.axel.pro@gmail.com. 
You should not need any specialist knowledge to run this code.
